Poet writing assistant for Android

This project uses a fine-tuned version of Gemma 3 1B, trained on the [Poetry Foundation dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tgdivy/poetry-foundation-poems)

Because of file size issues, the fine-tuned version of Gemma isn't provided with this repo. Please download gemma3-1b-it-int8-web.task and tokenizer.model here and place them under app/src/main/assets/models with the names gemma3.tflite and tokenizer.spm
